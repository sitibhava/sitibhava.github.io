### About Us

We’re dedicated to helping learners explore the Buddha’s teachings through Pali, the ancient language of the earliest Buddhist scriptures—the Tipiṭaka. Spoken over 2,500 years ago, Pali offers a direct path to understanding the Blessed One’s wisdom in its purest form, making it essential for deepening spiritual practice or scholarly study.

Our AI-powered translation tool supports this journey by providing rough meanings of Pali texts, making the Dhamma more accessible to beginners and practitioners alike. It’s a starting point for those without the time or expertise to master Pali fully.

**A Note of Caution:** Our AI translations, while helpful, aren’t perfect. Pali’s rich nuances can be challenging for technology to capture. We suggest treating these translations as guides, not final answers, and encourage consulting traditional sources or studying Pali yourself for true accuracy.

By combining modern tools with ancient wisdom, we aim to inspire a deeper connection to the Buddha’s teachings—one step at a time.
